Getting data from txt file and plotting to graph
"An application that can connect to any GNSS receiver via COMPORT (Bluetooth, USB, etc.) and map the data in real-time, allowing for data processing or recording. The recorded data can be reused, and it can also establish RTK connections. We designed the application to work with navigation systems. Many GNSS receivers and antennas were tested with the application, and GNSS data were compared according to weather conditions to measure the usability of the incoming data.
